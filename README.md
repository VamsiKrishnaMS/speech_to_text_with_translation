# speech_to_text_with_translation
German Audio/Video Translation to English with Subtitles  

This program processes any German audio or video file as input, translating it to English and generating English subtitles as output (subtitles.srt). 
It utilizes advanced speech-to-text and translation technologies to first convert the spoken German language into transcribed text and then translates the text into English. 
Once the translation is complete, the program synchronizes the translated text with the original media, producing a subtitle file that can be displayed alongside the video or embedded within it, providing accurate and context-aware English subtitles for German-language media.
